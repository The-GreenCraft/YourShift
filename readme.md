# What does YourShift do?



YourShift shows you regularly how long you have been on duty, when you can take lunch break and when your shift is over.
By default, a shift lasts 24h (-> 48 minutes in real).


If you want to change the duration of your shift consider:



 - 2 seconds in real time, is 1 minute in the game
 - 2 minutes in real time is one hour in the game
 - 1 day in game is 48 minutes in real time



As soon as you go on duty with your character, the timer will start. In the ini file you can define how often you want to be shown
how long your shift will last.
